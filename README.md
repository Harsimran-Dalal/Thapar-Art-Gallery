ART GALLERY FOR THAPAR STUDENTS

The idea we propose is related to OPEN INNOVATION. 
Our idea is to establish an online art gallery, exclusively showcasing the diverse talents of Thapar’s students.

•	PURPOSE: 
1)	To provide a platform for students to showcase their artistic talents.
2) To present a creative combination of technology and art.

•	FEATURES: 
1)	User- friendly interface to, allowing students to easily upload their artwork, including paintings, sketches, digital art, photography and more.
2)	Interactive features like likes, comments and shares to engage with each other’s work.
3)	Artists will be able to share their social media handles/ contacts, so as to promote their art work or business.

•	BENEFITS:
1)	Artists will gain visibility and recognition for their work.
2)	Opportunity to connect with peers, & mentors.
3)	Platform to promote art related businesses.


Far-sightedly, we can actually make it an Inter- college platform, so that all the artists from different colleges can interact with each other, promote their artwork, get recognized for their talent and the ones running an online art- business can actually benefit from this.
